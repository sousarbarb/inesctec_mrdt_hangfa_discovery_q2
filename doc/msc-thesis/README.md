The Hangfa Discovery Q2 platforms were firstly used at
[CRIIS - Centre for Robotics in Industry and Intelligent Systems](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/criis)
from
[INESC TEC - Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science](https://www.inesctec.pt/en)
by a student in 2016. This student was Fernando Jorge Marques de Sá, being
enrolled in the Master of Science (MSc) course in Electrical and Computers
Engineering (ECE) at the
[Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (FEUP)](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/).
The modifications made to the Hangfa platform in order to make it compatible
with perception and Simultaneous and Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on mobile
ground robots were not developed during Fernando's MSc Thesis.
Nevertheless, those modifications were possible given the knowledge gained in
terms of the platform limitations and usage.
