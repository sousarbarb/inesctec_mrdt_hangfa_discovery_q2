# Hangfa Discovery Q2

The Discovery Q2 is a small robot platform developed by
[HANGFA Robotics](https://www.hangfa-europe.com/).
This platform is a four-wheeled omnidirectional robot with 4 QMA10 mecanum
wheels driven by 4 coreless servo motors, supporting CAN bus and RS232 serial
ports. The original plaform provides a Software Development Kit (SDK), allowing
users to extend the capabilities of the plaform. This SDK provides a complete
communication protocol and source code samples based on the STM32F407.

## Limitations for Multimodal Perception

- No computer unit included to, e.g., run Robot Operating System (ROS)-based
  executable nodes
- Wheeled odometry data not available
- IMDR4 board does not have an interface to change the internal closed-loop
  control if needed
- Only 5V @ 5A external output provided to the user
- No native support for 3D LiDAR and RGBD cameras
