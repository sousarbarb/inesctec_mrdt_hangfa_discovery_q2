inesctec_mrdt_hangfa_discovery_q2:
Integrating Multimodal Perception into Ground Mobile Robots.
This framework presents a methodology to integrate multimodal perception into a
ground mobile platform, incorporating wheel odometry, 2D laser scanners, 3D
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and RGBD cameras.
The methodology describes the electronics design to power devices, firmware,
computation and networking architecture aspects, and
mechanical mounting for the sensory system based on 3D printing, laser cutting,
and bending metal sheet processes.
All the documentation and designs are accessible in a public repository:
https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/mrdt/open-source/inesctec_mrdt_hangfa_discovery_q2.
